**Summary**:
-
This game marks my first released 3D game. It was created with the purpose of creating a game from start to finish.
I took responsibility of a number of things that familiarised me with the various stages of Game Production.
Undergoing various courses and research detours to actually know what I'm doing, I heavily relied on a handwritten **Game Design Document** and Project Management using a [**Kanban board**](https://github.com/harshdulani/GraveYard-Rob/projects/1)

Along with creating models in **Blender** and researching for models that fit the art style and the performance requirements, I put my efforts into programming the different required systems such as:
 - A **3rd Person Controller** that is responsive, does what you need it to do and helps the character play the game instead of working against them.
 - **Camera** transitions (**Cinemachine**)
 - **Animator State Machine**
 - Creating and managing a **Terrain system and vegetation**
 - Lighting up the scene, adding atmosphericism
 - Unity's **Particle System** and **VFX**
